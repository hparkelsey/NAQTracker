# NAQTracker
JavaScript program to digitize the scorekeeping process of NAQT competitions.

Noticed frequent score disputes at Academic Team tournaments because scores were primitively kept using pencil and paper. 

Developed a program that digitizes the scorekeeping process of National Academic Quiz Tournament rounds to minimize human error, improve tournament efficiency, and guide users to easily keep accurate and consistent scores.
